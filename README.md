Assignment 2 Option B <br>
Section Sockets is all working fine - app can handle multiply clients. All options are working.
The only issue is validation. I only put validation for employee number as I had issue implemention other, so please use correct option and data.
Information about employees are stored in user_data.json<br>
Section Queue - Server is sending messages to queue and auditrabbit.py is consuming the queue, prints the queue and saves it to audit_log.txt<br>
Section Docker - didn't implement that. got issues with setting dockers in my Linux and my implementation didn't work<br><br>
